# Integration Fix Plan

## Critical Issues Identified

1. **Missing Factory Function**: `src/index.js` imports `createTimelineAugmentationService` but `src/services/timelineAugmentation.js` only exports the class
2. **File Integrity**: `src/utils/timelineDiagnostics.js` may be truncated or corrupted
3. **Application Startup**: Main application fails to start due to import errors

## Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Core Integration Issues

1. **Add Missing Factory Function**
   - Add `createTimelineAugmentationService` export to `timelineAugmentation.js`
   - Ensure it returns a properly configured instance of `TimelineAugmentationService`

2. **Verify File Integrity**
   - Check if `timelineDiagnostics.js` is complete and properly formatted
   - Fix any truncation or corruption issues
   - Ensure all exports are properly defined

3. **Test Application Startup**
   - Verify all imports in `src/index.js` resolve correctly
   - Test that the application starts without errors
   - Confirm all monitoring and debugging features are accessible

### Phase 2: Integration Testing

4. **End-to-End Functionality Test**
   - Run the application with real data to verify the duplicate placeholder fix works
   - Confirm monitoring and debugging features are operational
   - Validate performance improvements are realized

5. **Complete Performance Testing**
   - Finish the performance test suite that was running
   - Document performance improvements achieved
   - Mark the final task as completed

## Expected Outcomes

- ✅ Application starts successfully
- ✅ Timeline duplicate issue is resolved in production
- ✅ All monitoring and debugging features are functional
- ✅ Performance improvements are validated
- ✅ System is production-ready

## Next Steps

Switch to Code mode to implement these fixes systematically.
